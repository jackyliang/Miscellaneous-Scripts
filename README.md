Miscellaneous-Scripts
=====================

## Introduction

I guess calling this miscellaneous scripts is sort of an understatement. This has slowly became my repo that stores all my dot-files like my `.vim` and `.profile` files for backup in case of catastrophic failure, and in some ways my launchpad for learning vim as I edit my `.vimrc` and `.profile` files.

## Installation

TODO: add an `install.sh` file to do all the necessary symlinks, but for now, do the following:

    ln -s ~/Miscellaneous-Scripts/Bash/.profile ~/
    ln -s ~/Miscellaneous-Scripts/Bash/.marks ~/
    ln -s ~/Miscellaneous-Scripts/Bash/.vim ~/
    ln -s ~/Miscellaneous-Scripts/Bash/.vimrc ~/
    ln -s ~/Miscellaneous-Scripts/Bash/.tmux.conf ~/
